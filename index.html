            <h1>GOALS</h1>
            <p>
              I am passionate about all things human – in particular our
              technology, our art and our relationships with our world and each
              other. <br />
              The career I am building leverages these three elements of humanness
              to solve real issues and improve real lives.

            <h1>SKILLSET</h1>
            <p>
              My computer science background has lent itself to proficiencies in
              programming in Java, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br />
              Additionally, I am a strong verbal and written communicator and I
              thoroughly enjoy organising everything from my closet to a trip
              abroad.

            <p>
              I enjoy working with others and do best in environments where I can
              exercise my curiosity, where questions are encouraged and the
              culture lends itself to knowledge sharing and personal development.
              <br />
              I know I can learn and excel at anything, just give me half a
              chance.

              Fezeka Nzama earned her Bachelor of Business Science specialising in 
              Computer Science from the University of Cape Town in March of 2022. 
              During her time at UCT she was named on the Commerce Deans’ Merit List 
              and invited to join the Golden Key Honor Society multiple times, whilst 
              being an active member of the University community. She served on the 
              Graca Machel Hall Deputy House Committee as Head Student, worked as a 
              Graca Machel Hall Subwarden and Graca Machel Hall Student Front Desk 
              Co-ordinator. Additionally, Fezeka played for the UCT Hockey team, and 
              was on of the founders of StartUp Grind UCT, an entrepreneurship focused 
              student society aimed at equipping and uplifting young student entrepreneurs

              Outside of working in student leadership, Fezeka spent summers working in retail

              Fezeka spent a month interning with a top 3 consulting firm, working as a visiting 
              associate in a team with international consultants all over the world. That experience 
              was one of immense growth, with Fezeka picking up skills in excel, and Tableau data 
              visualisation whilst gaining insight into the hustle of corporate South Africa. 
              Since then, Fezeka has spent two years, living, and traveling through the United 
              States of America. Working as an au pair Fezeka has discovered new levels of patience 
              and empathy within herself, whilst while making a plethora of her travel dreams come true.
